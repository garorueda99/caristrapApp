# This is my Final Project for the Concordia Bootcamp Night & weekends CB-NW-3

## Project Description:

Create a Computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) for [Caristrap International Inc.,](http://caristrap.com/)

### What is CMMS?

It is software that maintains a computer database of information about an organization's maintenance operations. This information is intended to help maintenance workers do their jobs more effectively (for example, determining which machines require maintenance)

A todo list of all maintenance operations combined with a task scheduler (calendar)

Stacks:

- Vanilla Javascript
- React
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- MongoDB
- Magic.Link
- [React-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/)

## Objectives & MVP:

This project seeks to centralize the maintenance information for Caristrap International Inc. It is a tailor-made solution that:

- Must be "Up and Running". Current address [https://caristrap-app.vercel.app/](https://caristrap-app.vercel.app/)
- Controls company assets.
  - Where is supposed that the extinguishers are located?
  - Where is supposed that the security alarm panels are located?
  - How many computers do we have?
  - How many active machines do we have?
- Reminds due date of scheduled maintenance
- Keeps the records of the maintenance that has been done.
