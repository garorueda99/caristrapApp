This is my Final Project for the Concordia Bootcamp Night & weekends

Stacks:

- Vanilla Javascript
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- MongoDB
- Magic.Link

## Objectives & MVP:

This project seeks to centralize the maintenance information for Caristrap International Inc. It is a tailor-made solution that:

- Controls company assets.
- Reminds due date of scheduled maintenance
- Keeps the records of the maintenance done
